					<p>The Joker is a fictional character who appears in Christopher Nolan's 2008 superhero film The Dark Knight. Based upon the DC Comics character of the same name, he was played by Australian actor Heath Ledger.</p>
					<p>The Joker is the definition of pure evil.  Really, there is no way that one cannot believe that he is anything less.  Some people believe that he is a psychopath, but that is not true.  The Joker feels emotion, and the definition of psychopathy is that a person feels no emotion whatsoever.  His emotion may be sick humor, or anger, and occasional sadness when one of his plans doesn’t go right, but he does feel genuine emotion.  But even with his insanity, the fact is that he is a brilliant criminal mind.  He is not only able to think up complicated schemes very quickly, and set up all the necessary tools to get these plans going, but he can also adjust them very quickly when he needs to, as he often does since Batman is messing them up.</p>
					<p>The Dark Knight showed the Joker the way he was meant to be portrayed.  It really captured him in the best way possible.  The film showed a brilliant criminal mind who got bored with doing what normal criminals do.  His boredom led him to seek out Batman.  He spent that whole movie just trying to make a point – that Batman was just as corruptable as the rest of us.  He nearly destroyed half of Gotham to in the process, but that was the extent of what he wanted to do.  The little dialogue between Batman and the Joker at the police station showed it best.  He didn’t care about anything, other than chaos.</p>
